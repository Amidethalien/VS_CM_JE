  A small and easy to use C++ library for programming with TCP and UDP sockets on Linux/Unix

  @section intro Introduction

	CPPSocket is a small Classlibrary for C++ that supports a easy usage of socket-programming for
	networking-software.
	It provides a simple object-oriented interface to the classic C Library calls. Additionally it provides
	a simplified abstraction for creating clients and servers.

	With CPPSocket supports the following network protocols:
	- TCP (transmission control protocol; needs an established connection from one host to another)
	- UDP (user datagram protocol; packets can be sent without an established connection)
	- IPv4 (internet protocol version 4; uses 32-bit network addresses)
	
	These protocols are what may also be called TCP/IP.

  The library provides two layers of abstraction:
	- Low-Level \n
    This is a simple oo interface of the classic socket calls.
		But it provides some (optional) abstractions for addressing and buffering.
		Usefull for more experienced programmers, that have already worked with classic sockets.

	- High-Level \n
    This provides somewhat more abstraction and ignores some functionality of the full blown
		sockets.
		But nevertheless it is quite usefull and makes programming of networking software very easy.
		So it's intended to be used by novice programmers or those who don't want the maximum
		complexity/flexibility but an easy to use network-interface.

  The @ref tut explains the usage of the interfaces.
