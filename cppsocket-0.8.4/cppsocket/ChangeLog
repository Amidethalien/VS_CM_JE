0.8.1
	Some improvements in Socket class:
	- Socket behaves now like a file-descriptor
	  (Constructor, assignment, cast)

	Added wait4Connection() in TCPServer
	and use this in TCPThreadedServer.
	Additionally the threaded server gave control
	to the listen-thread.
	The server does only create this thread and stops it.

	Translate the whole comments and documents to english :)
